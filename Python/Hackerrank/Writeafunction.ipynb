    "An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:\n",
    "    * The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:\n",
    "        * The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.\n",
    "This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.\n",
    "Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "Read __year__, the year to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "1900 <= year <= 10^5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "The function must return a Boolean value (True/False). Output is handled by the provided code stub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input 0\n",
    "1990\n",

    "### Sample Output 0\n",
    "False\n",
